--------basic structure------
-have a different component for each part of page
    -map                    -play buttons (start, guess, quit)
    -info                   -direction buttons (n, s, w, e)
    -nav                    -score

    -have a tracker component that keeps track of scoring / tracks button clicks and deducts points? or do we not need this because we could just do an event listener to deduct with every onclick?


----------Leaflet--------
-explore leaflet more
-leaflet pip (for keeping everything zoned within state of VT borders)


--------random spot on map----------
-random integer function for long/lat (?)


--------buttons------
-every time a direction button is clicked, score decreases by 1 (onClick)
-enabling/disabling buttons
